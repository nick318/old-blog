Here is a page about me.

I am a Fullstack developer. I write Java and Js code.
On java it is Spring, Micronaut;
On js it is React with mobx

I'm also a part of open-source community, I contribute to some libraries. 
You can check my github [profile](https://github.com/nick318). 
I use [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/9142561/nick318) to solve problems
 when I have lack of knowledge.  
 
I have a few years of experience in automation testing. Mostly I write on Java and use 
following libraries: Junit, Rest-assured, Selenide, Selenium. I have built automation 
testing for web-services. Usually it was restful api. But I have mature experience with 
UI automation as well.

If you need any consulting within automation tests, feel free to contact by email "purger.sways_0v@icloud.com".

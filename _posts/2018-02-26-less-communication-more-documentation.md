Communication in software projects is quite popular theme to discuss. However we still have problems in the area.
We used to communicate via emails, bug tracker etc. It was communication with a long period to answer and was not well
managed. So people hate it. And popular agile [manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) was like a breath of fresh air.
People were inspired by the manifesto and started to say: "hey, we do not need documentation anymore. Read the principles
 of agile, it is telling us the most efficient way of communication is face-to-face."
  In my opinion it is a beginning of disaster.
  
 What's wrong with face-to-face communication? 
  The information and a decision which was made is hidden in your brain. It makes you more valuable for a project, since
   only you know some parts of application. But as you may notice your brain does not remember all. After some time you 
   will lose that information. And believe me it will be hard to realize why your code was written that way. It also 
   increases the bus-factor. If one of your team is sick. You lost information about a task which that guy is doing. 
   Modern applications often changes nowadays. Every code you write will be changed. Developer needs to know all 
   decisions which were made. Another problem with face-to-face is you always need to repeat the same information. I 
   mean if somebody asks you and you answer face-to-face, then next day another developer will ask you the same question,
   what will you do?
   
 What can you improve?
  Keep your thoughts and decisions are written in project management system. It can be comments on Jira task or github 
  issue. Even when your colleague is sitting next in your room. Communicate with your team inside tools which were made 
  for that. If you cannot do that for 100% of communication or you have some white boards meeting you can at least write
   down your thoughts when the meeting is finished.
   
   Conclusion I think in modern software development companies should sell not only properly worked software but all 
   communication history which was made by creation of the software. It is closely to design companies. They sell you
   final beautiful picture, but you also get all drafts with comments why they are not best to fit your needs.

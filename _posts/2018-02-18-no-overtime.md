When I was a junior engineer I often went back home later then I had to. Because I thought I delivered small results
to company during my work day. It was true, because every day I faced with a new problem and it took me some time to
solve. But I think this kind of thinking is wrong.

##### 1. Wrong expectations 
You may have wrong expectations about your current position. For example, I as a junior should deliver small results and
learn a lot. After some time, may be quickly that balance will be changed. But now, there is no sense to overtime. I do
not want to say that you should not spend additional time for learning. You definitely should. It is your responsibility
to grow up in career not a your company. But you should let you make that decision when to learn, when to rest. 

##### 2. Wrong estimates
Second problem that I faced with is wrong estimates. Even though I knew how to estimate. I wanted to say less time for
the job in order to make my manager happy. It is definitely wrong. Company hires you to make your job. Saying estimates 
is a part of your job too. So every time you tell wrong estimates you make a reason to overtime. And it is only your
problem not someone else.

##### 3. Work/life balance
The term is widely used. But I just want to add: do not make your life boring and busy. You can find a way how to spend
 time. You should just have some free time buffer. In order to think outside of work. Think about your growths, about 
 money and so on.
 
##### 4. Bad managers
Sometimes company may ask you to work overtime. It can be any reason, it may sound important. But in my opinion it is
 manager responsibility to get project done. If your project needs more time, there could be many reasons. First, it is 
 a wrong scope of tasks. When your project does not have enough people, manager should prioritize tasks, right? So make
 your scope clear, define tasks which your team can solve in time. In parallel you can search new people to join.
 
##### 5. Your brain does now work so much
 In IT field we often have tasks which we need to think some time to solve. It is not something you can get done just 
 sitting. Your brain has limited power to think. In my opinion average time of thinking is about 4 hours. Do not take
  that time as a ideal. That is why there are some techniques like [pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
  Let your brain rest for some periods between your task. Shortly when you overtime you just lie to yourself. You have 
  enough time to get things done, but your brain does not have enough power to think. Read about that.

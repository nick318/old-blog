title: "Are you a writer or a coder?"
---
Many years ago software developers had to solve deep technical problems while 
writing a basic code. What I mean here: you had to think a lot about usage of memory,
 about process architecture (what commands are supported) and so on. 
 Nowadays it all gone away. For now you use a lot of libraries to help you to make a 
 typical applications easier. Usually all you need to do is a briefly explain a business 
 logic that everyone can understand! Of course there are some special cases like google 
 search, language development etc.
 
  So who is a writer fo me? Well, let it be a William. Willy can clearly explain his thoughts in a 
  short way. He has known a big amount of words and before using each words he can think 
  for a few seconds, is it a good words for this place?
  
  To opposite of a writer there is a coder, let it be a Mark. Mark usually does not fully understand domain and
  business. He knows less words. He does not explain what is happen here. What is a process,
  a flow of business. All he does is make computer instructions. He does not think about what
   word to use. For him it is totally fine to use `i, j, m` names for variables. Some static
   analysis rules make him angry. He does not understand why it is important. All his thoughts are
   about computer. He rarely think about business. Methods with number postfix like `makeHappy`
    and `makeHappy2` are about his approach. 

  Write a comment below are you William or Mark?
